        Algorithm Alchemists is a non-profit organization (registered under Hack
        Club) that teaches coding to elementary and high school students through
        online classes. We believe that learning to code should be fun and
        engaging. Our passionate high school student teachers provide the right
        amount of homework, so students can master Python and move on to more
        advanced programming languages and concepts.
